The aim of this project is to develop a platform for a wireless sensor network,
which can be used in various applications, but primarily aimed at home
automation. 

\section{Context}\label{sec:context}

First, talk about social implications of home automation, how the market is
evolving, what kind of tech is around.

Second, look at what kinds of tech are available, mention how fast the industry
is moving, and therefore why it's worth surveying the landscape regularly to
scout out new solutions and test them. Take some established products and show
how they have been out-specced by more recent chips, only a few years later. Use
the BQ25504 as an example.

\section{Cahier des Charges}\label{sec:cdc}

In this section, we shall briefly look through the requirements set forth for
this project. Each item will be examined fully in the rest of this document.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Low production cost} : the system must be scalable within
    a domestic environment and therefore remain very affordable. The aim is for
    the main components to cost less than 10 CHF. % TODO : units!
  \item \emph{Ultra low consumption} : wireless modules must be able to run for
    a very long time on a single charge. We shall also attempt to verify
    whether it is possible for the device to run using only indoor solar power.
  \item \emph{Bidirectional RF} : % TODO : mention current project?
    in order to work as a network, all devices must be able to communicate both
    way. This will allow at the very least for an end device to acknowledge
    that it has correctly received an instruction.
  \item \emph{Processing power} : the basic platform must be able to run some
    algorithms on live audio data, and therefore must be capable of calculating
    a basic \ac{FFT} in real time.\marginpar{These specifications were first
    aimed at a very specific example and then later generalized.}
  \item \emph{I/O} : each basic module should have some spare inputs and
    outputs which can be used to drive LEDs or relays (using \ac{PWM} if
    necessary) and gather input from switches or sensors.
  \item \emph{Analog Inputs} : the device must have at least one analog input.
  \item \emph{Storage} : the device must have sufficient memory to run the
    algorithms necessary for the target application.\footnote{As the target
    application had not been clearly defined when the project requirements were
    drafted, this is quite a subjective requirement.}
\end{itemize}

The goal of this project is to evaluate the various wireless communication
standards that are currently on the market, and produce a working proof of
concept for a very basic communication between two nodes. It will concentrate
mostly on researching existing solutions and producing the necessary hardware to
evaluate the platform. The software will not play an important part in this
stage of the project.

\section{Power}\label{sec:power}

%TODO : explain solar power and stuffs

The nodes should be able to survive on solar power. Their power usage pattern
is quite different from that of the ``router'' devices. % TODO : explain this
