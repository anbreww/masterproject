\section{Communication}\label{sec:communication}

The main specification that must be decided before we can start working on the
design is the communication method.

% TODO : blurb about what's needed : frequency, MAC, PHY, protocols, etc.

In order to create a useful platform for home automation, the following features
are desirable:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Universal} :
    The standards used to communicate must be universal and available worldwide,
    so that the same hardware can be used anywhere without the need to develop
    region-specific versions

  \item \emph{Popular network stack} : 
    The network stack should ideally be a popular industry standard. This will
    likely ensure that it is supported by more vendors, leading in turn to more
    available libraries, more documentation and more support. By using
    a well-established standard, we can ensure that if one vendor drops their
    support, there will still be many others to choose from.

  \item \emph{Interoperability} : small sensor devices are not very useful on
    their own. It is important to be able to extend the network. The best way to
    achieve this, in the author's opinion, is to rely on \emph{open standards},
    which would allow devices from multiple vendors to communicate using
    a common set of standards and protocols. 

  \item \emph{Reachable from anywhere} : if the application requires it, each
    node must be reachable from anywhere the user may be. It is important for
    the sensor network to be able to interface with the global internet if need
    be. More details about this can be found in \autoref{sub:ipv6}.

  \item \emph{Mesh topology (or similar)} : This can drastically improve the
    range of a sensor network while keeping infrastructure costs low. See
    \autoref{sec:topology} for more details.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IPv6}\label{sub:ipv6}

IPv6, which stands for Internet Protocol Version 6 si the next standard that
will be used for communication between networked devices around the world. It
was designed to replace the current IPv4, which most people will be familiar
with at the moment.

One of the key differences between the two versions of the protocol is the size
of the address pool. IPv4, which most people will be familiar with at this time,
defines the address of a device as 32 bits, usually represented as four groups
of eight digits, such as in the form \texttt{128.178.50.12}. Unfortunately, with
the growing number of internet-connected devices, the pool of available
addresses is steadily running out. IPv6 is an answer to this concern (among many
others), as it provides $2^{128}$ possible addresses, namely $3.4 \cdot 10^{38}$
addresses. 

The technical details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this project.
We will refer the reader to the innumerable information sources available on the
web, as well as the book ``Migrating to IPv6'' by Marc
Blanchet\citep{blanchet2006}, which explains these issues in detail.

A discussion on the use of IPv6 for sensor networks can be found in the book
``Interconnecting smart objects with IP''\citep[chap. 4]{dunkels2010}, under the chapter
\emph{IPv6 for Smart Object Networks and the Internet of Things}.

What we shall retain, in the context of this project, is that by using this new
protocol, we can provide every device with its own indivual address, allowing it
to be reachable over the global internet. This will allow us to poll sensors
individually or send commands to devices from anywhere in the world, with no
need for a local application-specific gateway to translate commands between the
embedded devices and the outside.

This is one of the promises of 6LoWPAN, which we will cover later in the
discussion of protocol stacks, in \autoref{sub:6lowpan}



\section{Topology}\label{sec:topology}

Wireless devices have the possibility to form links with any other device within
their range. It is therefore important to define how these devices will
communicate together : whether we will simply link two devices together in
a point-to-point fashion (essentially replacing a wire with a radio link), to
broadcast from one device to all receivers within range, or to use a more
complex topology.

There are many possibilities available\footnote{for more examples of topologies,
see \citep[sec. 2.3.4]{hunn2010}.}, but we will only cover the most popular
option : mesh topology.

One of the differentiating factors of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is the ability
to form a mesh network. This is one of the most complex topologies to implement,
but luckily its operation is covered by existing user libraries already, which
makes it an excellent choice for developing robust applications.

In a mesh network, nodes are differentiated by their role. In this case, there
are two possibilities. \emph{End nodes} are low-powered nodes that spend most of
their time asleep. In some cases, they will wake up periodically to check for
any pending messages. In others, they will remain asleep until they have data to
transmit. These devices are interconnected by \emph{routers} : nodes that are
always awake, ready to relay messages between other nodes.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gfx/snippets/mesh}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Mesh topology\citep{hunn2010}}
  \label{fig:mesh-topology}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:mesh-topology} illustrates the way that nodes are connected
together. The white circles are end nodes, whilst the grey circles represent
routers. As their name suggests, \emph{end} nodes are only meant to be at the
edges of the network and will not relay messages. The black circle is a special
kind of router node, called the \emph{coordinator}. This node handles the
creation and management of the network and must always be present.
\marginpar{note: IEEE~802.15.4 also allows the creation of a star topology, if
a mesh network is not needed.}
% TODO : perhaps mention beacon mode

In practice, this topology has two important advantages.

First, it allows the network to be extended with very little infrastructure
cost. Indeed, if two end nodes are too far apart, all that is needed is to place
one or more router nodes in between them. These will then automatically relay
data between the neighbour nodes. For example, it is likely that in a domestic
environment two nodes will only achieve a range of one storey vertically. If the
network required fixed infrastructure (as is the case for a WiFi network for
instance), a dedicated access point would have to be installed at least every
other storey. However, in the case of a mesh network, the router nodes on each
floor will be able to relay messages between the floor above and the floor
below.

Second, having multiple devices in the same area will increase the robustness of
the network. When a message is to be transmitted, nodes will auto-discover the
most efficient path to deliver it. If some nodes along that path are moved
around or fail, the network will re-route to avoid the faulty paths. 


\section{Operating frequency}\label{sec:frequency}

The first choice to be made is the frequency of operation. This is quite an
important topic as it will impose restrictions on the type of networking
protocols that will be available. Some frequency bands can cause interference
with common household equiment more than others. Furthermore, some choices also
limit the target markets : some frequency bands are not available in all
countries around the world or require special licenses.

We will cover only the most common choices and explain our reasoning for each
one. Since the devices under development are to be used in a domestic
environment by a regular consumer, they must be usable without a specific radio
license. It would also be preferable if the devices did not have to be modified
according to the market they will be deployed in. The frequency choices are
grouped in the \ac{ISM} band, which makes them possible to use license-free, but
also subject to interference from other household devices such as microwave
ovens.

\marginpar{Note: the \SI{5}{GHz} band will be omitted as it is currently
used only for WiFi, from the IEEE~802.11n standard and further}
At the moment, the most popular choices for wireless networks are the so-called
``Sub-GHz'' band, and the 2.4 to \SI{2.5}{GHz} band, which will be described
below.

\subsection{Sub-GHz}

The main appeal of the sub-GHz band is that it is less crowded than the
\SI{2.4}{GHz} band. This is becoming increasingly true with time as we are
seeing more and more devices in this part of the spectrum. Laptop computers,
home audio systems, smartphones all contribute to noise in this band, which is
shared between Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and many other technologies. Therefore
it can be quite attractive to develop a sensor network which functions outside
of this frequency range, in hopes that it will be more reliable.

Currently, the main disadvantage of this frequency range is the lack of
worldwide consensus on frequency allocations. The \ac{ITU} divides the world
into three regions, for managing the radio spectrum:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Region 1} : Europe, Africa, the Middle East and most of the
    ex-Soviet Union.
  \item \emph{Region 2} : North and South America, Greenland and some of the
    Pacific Islands.
  \item \emph{Region 3} : most of Asia and Oceania.
\end{itemize}

These three regions are illustrated on \autoref{fig:itu-regions}, taken from the
Swiss website of the \ac{ITU}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \makebox[\textwidth][c]{
      \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{gfx/itu-regions}
    }
  \end{center}
  \caption{ITU Regions [itu.ch]}
  \label{fig:itu-regions}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\SI{433}{MHz}}

The \SI{433}{MHz} ISM band (\SIrange{433.05}{434.79}{MHz})
 is a very popular choice for short range,
low cost devices. Its use is mainly for remote controlled devices, such as light
switches or garage door openers. It is usually used for one-way transmissions.

In Switzerland, the power limit for \SI{433}{MHz} is \SI{1}{mW} at 100\% duty
cycle, or \SI{10}{mW} at 10\% duty cycle.\footnote{National Frequency Allocation Plan
\url{http://www.bakom.admin.ch/themen/frequenzen/00652/00653/index.html?lang=en}}

According to the ITU, this frequency band is only available to Europe and the
Middle East (Region 1). However, the FCC grants a regional exception that allows
the \SI{433}{MHz} band to be used in the United States (Region 2).

Currently though, there doesn't seem to be any widespread use of networking
stacks operating at this frequency. The IEEE has only recently amended the
802.15.4 standard to add support for this frequency
range\footnote{IEEE~802.15.4c\texttrademark{}-2009 : Amendment 2 : Alternative Physical Layer
Extension to support one or more of the Chinese 314-316~MHz, 430-434~MHz, and
779-787~MHz bands.}

\subsubsection{868 / \SI{915}{MHz}}

The second option that we will consider in the sub-GHz band is around
\SI{900}{MHz}. Unfortunately, it operates in slightly different frequency ranges
depending on the target region. In \ac{ITU} Region 1, it is centered around
\SI{863.5}{MHz}, whereas in ITU Region 2, the devices will operate around
\SI{915}{MHz}.

This choice is becoming more common and is being heavily marketed by silicon
chip makers as an alternative to \SI{2.4}{GHz} for mesh networking. The
IEEE~802.15.4 in its 2003 version allows for 10 communication channels in the
US, and only one channel in Europe. The 2006 revision extends the number of
channels to 30 for the US (The European version remains unchanged).

% TODO : reword the following paragraph
Devices operating in this frequency range are becoming increasingly common. Most
major chip manufacturers are producing chips that can switch between these bands
( 433 / 868 /\SI{915}{MHz}).\footnote{One example is Texas Instruments' CC1101
: \url{http://www.ti.com/product/cc1101}.}

\subsection{\SI{2.4}{GHz}}

This band is currently the most popular part of the spectrum for personal
electronic devices that must communicate together. Current applications include
WiFi, Bluetooth, and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is the basis for ZigBee
and \ac{6LoWPAN}, which will be covered in \autoref{sub:6lowpan}.

This popularity has its advantages as well as drawbacks. One of the main
advantages is that there are a very wide variety of devices now available that
operate at this frequency. 

In spite of this caveat, the author's previous experience with ZigBee
devices\footnote{tests were done using Digi XBee Series 2 transceivers, using
1/4 wave whip antennas. Although not documented in this report, it was possible
to establish a reliable communication between three floors.}
has shown that in a typical domestic environment, with many wireless devices
active, it is possible to achieve a reliable link between devices in different
rooms and on different floors. Furthermore, we will be favouring a networking
stack that can provide mesh capabilities, as explained in
\autoref{sec:topology}. This will lower the importance of the range, as
extending the range of the network is a simple matter of adding a cheap repeater
(router) device at some point in the data path. For example, if communication
cannot be established between the first and third floors, a router can be placed
on the second floor to bridge the gap between those two domains.


\section{Comparison}

To sum up this section, all three frequency options are compared in
\autoref{tab:frequency-comparison}. One criteria was added which was not
discussed up to this point : antenna size.

Although regulations on emission power and bands change from region to region,
the size of the antenna is directly linked to the operating frequency. This is
important to note, as a larger antenna will require more board space, or
a longer piece of wire, which will take more space inside or around an
enclosure.

For this comparison, we used a quarter wave antenna, whose length can be
calculated with the following formula :

\begin{equation*}
  L = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{c}{\nu},
\end{equation*}

where

\begin{tabular}[h!]{ll}
$c$   & speed of light  \\
$\nu$ & carrier frequency \\
\end{tabular}

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption[Frequency comparison]{Frequency comparison}
  \label{tab:frequency-comparison}
\end{table}


\bigskip
Based on these facts, we chose to favour a \SI{2.4}{GHz} solution for our
design. This guarantees that the same product can be used in any region in the
world, as well as requiring the smallest antenna. At design time, there were
also more 802.15.4-compatible chips available on the market for \SI{2.4}{GHz}
than for any other operating frequency, as can be seen from the comparisons in
\autoref{sec:chips}.

\section{Network stacks}\label{sec:stacks}

Before choosing a hardware solution, we must decide how we wish to communicate
at the software level. If our communication standard acts as a simple
remplacement for a serial connection, sending commands is as trivial as sending
and receiving some characters on a UART interface. If we wish to do anything
more complex, such as mesh networking, we will have to use a complete networking
stack, or develop our own.

Since developing our own network stack is beyond the scope of this project, we
will rely instead on some well-established standards. There is a large amount of
standards to choose from, so we will only present a few candidates and explain
the reasoning behind our choices.

It is interesting to note that although there are many software solutions
available, most are based on one of two standards for the lower-level
specifications (the physical layer, known as \emph{PHY}, and the link layer,
referred to as \emph{MAC}, the bottom two layers of the OSI model\footnote{for
more information : \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model}.}).

The IEEE~802.15 working group focuses on \ac{WPAN}s. Bluetooth uses the
IEEE~802.15.1 standard, while almost all other stacks referred to here are based
on IEEE~802.15.4. This implies that unless constrained by licensing requirements
or physical memory, most of the common networking stacks should be
interchangeable. As we will see, this does not necessarily mean that all stacks
are portable across devices, as some are proprietary and only available on
certain architectures.

\subsection{Bluetooth Low Energy}\label{sub:bluetooth}

TODO : blurb about bluetooth 4.0 and Low Energy, how it consumes less than the
standards before, which weren't sufficiently low-power for a proper sensor
network.

Although Bluetooth 4.0 seems like a promising technology, and is already being
integrated into consumer products such as the iPhone 4S, at the time we looked
into wireless networking standards for this project, chips compatible with this
standard were not yet widely available. This option was therefore put to the
side, but would be worth considering for a new project.

\subsection{ZigBee}\label{sub:zigbee}

ZigBee is a very well-established industry standard for wireless sensor
networks.\footnote{the ZigBee alliance (\url{http://www.zigbee.org}) has over
300 industy members.}

It is based on the IEEE~802.15.4 physical standard, and adds several
useful features such as application profiles and security. It supports several
topologies, including mesh networking.

The main advantage of this standard is that it is very popular, and therefore
many chip vendors propose a ZigBee stack compatible with their products. This,
combined with application profiles, means that in theory it is possible to
connect multiple devices together from different vendors and ensure that they
communicate with the same standard.

The biggest disadvantage of the ZigBee protocol stack is that it requires
a license for commercial use. Some vendors, such as Microchip\footnote{\url{
http://www.microchipdirect.com/ProductSearch.aspx?Keywords=SW183053 }} require
a payment in order to use the stack which is compatible with their
devices.\footnote{at the time of writing, Microchip's ZigBee stack sells for
\$995.}

\subsection{6LoWPAN}\label{sub:6lowpan}

\ac{6LoWPAN} is an open standard, developed by the \ac{IETF}, which aims to create
a bridge between low-powered devices and the global internet. It is built on the
IEEE~802.14.5 standard, and supports multiple topologies, including mesh
networking. 

One of the distinguishing features of 6LoWPAN is that instead of using
a proprietary format for data packets, it uses a compressed version of IPv6
headers. This enables any 6LoWPAN network to be connected to the global internet
by using a so-called \emph{edge router} : a device which will bridge both
networks together by compressing/decompressing packets and forwarding them to
the relevant interface.\footnote{for more details, we recommend \citep[sec.
6.4]{shelby2010}. For a more thorough introduction to 6LoWPAN, \citep[chap.
16]{dunkels2010} is a good start.} The advantage of this solution is that it
   requires little overhead and is therefore well suited to cheap and
   low-powered devices with limited processing power. Only one edge router is
   required to connect one cluster of devices to the Internet.

Although vendor support is not yet as good as for ZigBee, many open source
projects have support for 6LoWPAN on various architectures. The Contiki
OS\footnote{ \url{http://www.contiki-os.org} } project is an example that is
often used in academic research. 

Unllike ZigBee, the 6LoWPAN standard itself does not specify application
profiles. However, several projects are under way to develop an open standard
for application profiles. The standard currently under development by the IETF
is named \ac{CoAP}\footnote{ \url{
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-08 }}


\subsection{Z-Wave}\label{sub:z-wave}


\subsection{MiWi}\label{sub:miwi}

\subsection{Network Stacks : summary}

A table comparing ZigBee (various versions), Z-Wave, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN etc
would be nice.

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  }
  \caption[Network stack summary]{Network stack summary}
  \label{tab:stack-comparison}
\end{table}

Explain that the choice between ZigBee and 6LoWPAN is more subjective than
technical, and that it's difficult to predict where the market will go in the
near future, and that the technology for the internet of things has not been
decided yet. However, it is very likely that it will work only if it is based on
open standards and if everyone collaborates. This is why we chose IEEE 802.15.4
on \SI{2.4}{GHz}, because the same hardware would allow us to make a ZigBee or
6LoWPAN compatible network.

\section{RF Chips}\label{sec:chips}

Here, we'll talk about the various microcontrollers on the market

\subsection{Multi-chip solution vs. System-on-Chip}

Do a cost comparison. 
Explain technical advantages (notably space saved on PCB) and disadvantages
(software is more complex, less separation of application vs stack).

Mention some advantages like the over-the-air bootloader for STM32 and the
Jennet-IP solution (and why we couldn't use it!) \footnote{Jennet IP was to be
released under an open source license in the fourth quarter of 2011
: \url{http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216038/Home-or-commercial-lighting-comes-under-Internet-control}
but it's still not available today}

Now we'll want to somehow format the huge excel table into something we can
include in a report\ldots hmmm.

% TODO : incorporate this somewhere

From a portability and cost point, it may be preferable to have the networking
stack and hardware in one dedicated and cheap module, and adapt the target
hardware to the desired application. There is no need to use a device with
a Cortex M3 core to read a temperature sensor or turn off a light. However, some
application may call for more processing power, such as an M4 or an FPGA, in
which case the processing power of the STM32W will be wasted, and it will simply
be added to the cost for nothing.

\section{Observations}

What we've deduced from the project : was it the right choice? What could we
have done better?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Power consumption} : original specifications called for an audio
    amplification stage, which would have used tens of micro Amps.
    % TODO : get proper data
    Therefore a difference between 400nA and 20nA was not significant. However,
    if the system is designed to be completely turned off most of the time, then
    a combination of an ultra low power microcontroller with a CC2420 or atmel
    chip would be much more efficient.
  \item \emph{Antenna diversity} : performance in the \SI{2.4}{GHz} band is pretty
    random (show some examples!). Very sensitive to positioning and orientation.
    Some chips now offer antenna diversity (link to very recent Atmel chip),
    which could be a very interesting option if space permits. Especially if
    using PCB antenna, would not increase costs too much.
\end{itemize}


\section{Microcontroller}

A few words on the STM32, what is specific about it, talk about the M3 core, the
instruction set, cpu clock
