\section{Operating frequency}\label{sec:frequency}

Explain what choices are available

\subsection{433 MHz}

\subsection{Sub-GHz}

What are the advantages? Why didn't we choose this?

\subsection{2.4 GHz}

\section{In hindsight}

What have we learned? Would it have been better to choose a different frequency?

\section{Network stacks}\label{sec:stacks}

A table comparing ZigBee (various versions), Z-Wave, Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN etc
would be nice.
Explain the mostly subjective reasons for choosing a solution based on open
standards, IETF approved drafts etc. 

Explain that the choice between ZigBee and 6LoWPAN is more subjective than
technical, and that it's difficult to predict where the market will go in the
near future, and that the technology for the internet of things has not been
decided yet. However, it is very likely that it will work only if it is based on
open standards and if everyone collaborates. This is why we chose IEEE 802.15.4
on 2.4 GHz, because the same hardware would allow us to make a ZigBee or 6LoWPAN
compatible network.

\section{RF Chips}\label{sec:chips}

Here, we'll talk about the various microcontrollers on the market

\subsection{Multi-chip solution vs. System-on-Chip}

Do a cost comparison. 
Explain technical advantages (notably space saved on PCB) and disadvantages
(software is more complex, less separation of application vs stack).

Mention some advantages like the over-the-air bootloader for STM32 and the
Jennet-IP solution (and why we couldn't use it!) \footnote{Jennet IP was to be
released under an open source license in the fourth quarter of 2011
: \url{http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216038/Home-or-commercial-lighting-comes-under-Internet-control}
but it's still not available today}

Now we'll want to somehow format the huge excel table into something we can
include in a report\ldots hmmm.

\section{Observations}

What we've deduced from the project : was it the right choice? What could we
have done better?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Power consumption} : original specifications called for an audio
    amplification stage, which would have used tens of micro Amps.
    % TODO : get proper data
    Therefore a difference between 400nA and 20nA was not significant. However,
    if the system is designed to be completely turned off most of the time, then
    a combination of an ultra low power microcontroller with a CC2420 or atmel
    chip would be much more efficient.
  \item \emph{Antenna diversity} : performance in the 2.4 Ghz band is pretty
    random (show some examples!). Very sensitive to positioning and orientation.
    Some chips now offer antenna diversity (link to very recent Atmel chip),
    which could be a very interesting option if space permits. Especially if
    using PCB antenna, would not increase costs too much.
\end{itemize}
