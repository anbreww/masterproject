\section{Version 1}

Explain some details of the design, explain choice for components, say a few
words about the audio part?

\section{Version 2}

Explain why we dropped the audio part. Complete reasoning for each pin of the
expansion port. Why we dropped the programming connector.

\section{Example application : Triac module}

Explain that the aim of the project was not to produce a design with lots of
applications but rather to provide a test platform and sufficient data to
compare available solutions. Application-specific modules are to be developed
later on when an application has been chosen.
