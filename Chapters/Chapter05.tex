Here we'll discuss some compromises that were made. Notably:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of knowledge in RF design, so we went with the reference design for
    the chip.
  \item Time constraints, needed to push through with the design, otherwise it
    would have been better to test various different antenna designs. 
  \item Chosing a different chip : if the requirements had been a little
    different, we could have chosen a different solution, which would have been
    cheaper, more powerful and/or more energy efficient.
\end{itemize}
