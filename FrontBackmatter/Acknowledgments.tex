\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Mathieu, for his continued supervision
during this project, for his insight into my design problems, and for getting me
back on track when I wandered too far from my objectives.

My thanks go to Professor Hannes Bleuler for allowing me to pursue a project in
a subject that is relevant to my interests. Thank you also to Daniel Burnier,
for his advice and assistance with Altium Designer, and more generally to
everyone at LSRO1 for making this place enjoyable to work in.

Finally, thanks to the eLab, more particularly Fabrizio Lo Conte and his student
Jean-Baptiste Haury for allowing us to use their test equipment and spending
time with us to set up our experiments and compare the results of our work.
