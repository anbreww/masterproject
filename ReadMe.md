# Andrew Watson's Masters Thesis
## Developing a wireless sensor network platform

These are the sources for my 2011-2012 Masters thesis. 

Based on the 'Classic Thesis' style for LaTeX.

It might need most of the TeXlive distribution to compile correctly. Also, the
github repository only holds the text files. all images (for the moment) are in
the gfx folder which is currently versioned using Dropbox.
